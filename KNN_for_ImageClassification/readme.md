## 1. KNN for Image Classification
KNN classifier for CIFAR-10 from scratch with PyTorch. KNN is data driven,
image classification algorithm that was popular before Deep Learning came out. 
So I structured my PyTorch porfolio projects according to timeline of algorithms were developed (Popular)
So I have started with KNN
