## Double-Stage Object Detector (Faster R-CNN)

In this project I implemented a two-stage object detector, based on Faster R-CNN, which consists of two modules, Region Proposal Networks (RPN) and Fast R-CNN and extends previous project YOLO detector. I use it to train a model that can detect objects on novel images and evaluate the detection accuracy using the classic metric mean Average Precision (mAP)
