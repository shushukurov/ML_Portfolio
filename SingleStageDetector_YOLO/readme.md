Single-Stage Object Detector

In project I implemented a single-stage object detector, 
based on YOLO (v1 and v2) and used it to train a model that can detect objects on novel images. 
I also evaluated the detection accuracy using the classic metric mean Average Precision (mAP). 
In Next project (That extends this project), I will implement a two-stage object detector, based on Faster R-CNN. 
The main difference between the two is that single-stage detectors perform region proposal and 
classification simultaneously while two-stage detectors have them decoupled.
