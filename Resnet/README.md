## Resnet (Pre-Resnet + BottleNeck block)

This project is motivated by my desire to deeply understand the state of art architecutre 'Residual network' AKA 'Resnet'. When I was studying CNNs for visual recognition I always tried to understand papers first then re-implement by myself using favourite tools e.g Pytorch or Numpy. However, I could not fint any tutorial to re-implement Resnet based architures from scratch using pytorch (All I could find using PyTorch Implemented models from Model Zoo) So I decided to try myself mainly by looking on CS231n lecture notes (Mainly raw NumPy based code) and re-implent it using only PyTorch
